Don't make the accel too high or else it'll skip gears inside the motor while getting up to speed or when changing the speed.
The current speed set is the fastest it can go for this microstepping, dont' change it.

There's a sensor that it supposed to go inside the door in order to make sure it doesn't run while it's open.
It's currently taped to some metal surface.

Current status: it's functional but sometimes will crash.

Next step: Tune the timing, accel, and/or other variables in order to make it stop crashing.
